## Find the words

{% include button.html href="/app-wordfind/?__/" text="Word find" %}

See how many Chinese words you can find in the grid.

{% include clear.html %}

__ In the game, words can go in all eight directions.

__ In the first game, words only go from left to right, from top to bottom, from top-left to bottom-right, and from top-right to bottom-left. In the second one, they can be in all eight directions.

To select the word you found in the game, press the mouse button or touch on the first letter of the word, move the cursor or your finger through all letters in the word, and release the mouse button or your finger on the last letter. Once you finish all the words, the grid will turn green. You can share the finished puzzle with me.
