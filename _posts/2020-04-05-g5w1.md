Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome to the new method of learning Chinese!

For the first week we are going to review *Unit 12 Clothing*. You are going to use some online resources to help you with your learning.

## Tool 1: Quizlet

### Step 1

Go to [the "Unit 12 Yīfú/Fúzhuāng (1)" set on Quizlet][quizlet].

### Step 2

Use "Flashcards" to review all the vocabulary first. Remember, flashcards can help you fresh your memory. Don't skip it!

### Step 3

Just like we did in our class. You need to finish the practice "Test". Your score should above 85% so that you can play the games after! But if your score is below 85% at the first try, that's okay! Just go back to "Flashcards" to review the vocabulary one more time and then test yourself again, I believe you can get it this time!

### Step 4

You can play "Match" and/or "Gravity". Remember to write down your best time record for Match and the highest level you passed for Gravity. You can also share your results with me by email to [mzhan@hawken.edu][email].

## Tool 2: Kahoot

Go to [the game "Kahoot Challenge"][kahoot]. Before game start type your First Name so that I can keep track with all of you. Please type your real name, don’t make up names.
