Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome back to our remote Chinese language class in the second week. In this week, students are going to practice and finish more activities about fruits.

Students need parents' help with the following contents. These activities are for several days. Students don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your kids' schedule and study on their own pace.

## Try to read

{% include button.html href="/app-read/?fruits1/" text="Read part 1" %}{% include button.html href="/app-read/?fruits2/" text="Read part 2" %}

Students will practice pronunciation themselves by reading the words to the computer.

{% include clear.html %}

For this part, students need to use [Google Chrome][chrome] to browse the web page to make it work.

In each word card, the picture and its pinyin are given. When you click the "Go" button, the computer will read the word first, and then ask students to read it and record their pronunciation. If the pronunciation is accurate enough, the card will turn green and shows "Correct!". Otherwise, try it again. Let me know when they make all cards green.

## Memory game

{% include button.html href="/app-memory-game/?data=fruits1&imagesAvailable=10&grid=4x5" text="Play game 1" %}{% include button.html href="/app-memory-game/?data=fruits2&imagesAvailable=10&grid=4x5" text="Play game 2" %}

Have fun with the game and I would be so excited to know how well they do in the game!

{% include clear.html %}

## Find the words

{% include button.html href="/app-wordfind/?fruits1ez/" text="Word find 1" %}{% include button.html href="/app-wordfind/?fruits2ez/" text="Word find 2" %}

See how many Chinese words your kids can find in the grid. In both games, words only go from left to right and from top to bottom.

{% include clear.html %}

Students may need to review the spelling of the words before playing the game. Use the [slides from the last week][slides], also included at the top of this page, to help them to review.

In the game, to select the word found, press the mouse button or touch on the first letter of the word, move the cursor or finger through all letters in the word, and release the mouse button or finger on the last letter. Once all the words are found, the grid will turn green.

## Origami fruits set

Download the document and print it out. They can make their own fruit origami sets.
