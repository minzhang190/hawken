Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome to the new method of learning Chinese!

For the first week of remote Chinese class, we will review Fruits. You are going to use some online resources to help you with your learning.

Here is the instruction:

## Step 1

Go to [the "shuǐ guǒ" set on Quizlet][quizlet].

## Step 2

Use "Flashcards" to review all the vocabulary first. Remember, flashcards can help you fresh your memory. Don't skip it!

## Step 3

Just like we did in our class. You need to finish the practice "Test". Your score should above 85% so that you can play the games after! But if your score is below 85% at the first try, that's okay! Just go back to "Flashcards" to review the vocabulary one more time and then test yourself again, I believe you can get it this time!

## Step 4

You can play "Match" and/or "Gravity". Remember to write down your best time record for Match and the highest level you passed for Gravity. You can also share your results with me by email to [mzhan@hawken.edu][email].
