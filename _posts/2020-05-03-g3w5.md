Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome back to our remote Chinese language class in the fifth week. In this week, you'll learn the next 12 words of 37 words in total.

These activities are for several days. You don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your schedule and study on your own pace.

## Identify yourself

{% include button.html href="/app-identify/" text="Identify me" %}

Stop by this identification page and enter your name, then submit.

{% include clear.html %}

This will allow me to track your progress, including your recordings in the "[Try to read](#try-to-read)" section. It's recommended that every time you come back to these activities, check out the identification page first, and if your name is not shown there, provide it again so it can get tracked correctly.

## Learn the words

{% include button.html href="/app-slides/?clsrmobj2/" text="View slides" %}

Check out the slides to learn the vocabulary. In the slides, you're going to learn those 12 words in this unit.

{% include clear.html %}

Pay attention to the pronunciation of each word. Each word will be read twice in Chinese followed by once in English. After all the words, there will be a mini-quiz for self-check.

## Whack-a-mole!

{% include button.html href="/app-whack-a-mole/?data=clsrmobj2" text="Whack-a-mole!" %}

Here is a new game. This new game will help you to learn the vocabulary, and have some fun.

{% include clear.html %}

There are three levels in this game. Earn enough points in one level to advance to the next one.

## Try to read

{% include button.html href="/app-read/?clsrmobj2/#{%22service%22:%22record-firebase%22}" text="Read" %}

You'll practice pronunciation yourself by reading the words to the computer. Your pronunciation will be recorded and sent to me automatically.

{% include clear.html %}

For this part, I recommend using [Google Chrome][chrome] on a computer or Android device to finish the activity. In each word card, the picture and its pinyin are given. When you click the "Go" button, the computer will read the word first, and then ask you to read it and record your pronunciation for a maximum of 10 seconds, or you can stop the recording at a earlier time manually. A playback option is also available so you can listen to your own pronounciation, and record it again if you're not satisified with your previous attempt.

## Find the words

{% include button.html href="/app-wordfind/?clsrmobj2/" text="Word find" %}

See how many Chinese words you can find in the grid.

{% include clear.html %}

In the first game, words only go from left to right, from top to bottom, from top-left to bottom-right, and from top-right to bottom-left. In the second one, they can be in all eight directions.

In the game, to select the word you found, press the mouse button or touch on the first letter of the word, move the cursor or your finger through all letters in the word, and release the mouse button or your finger on the last letter. Once you finish all the words, the grid will turn green. You can share the finished puzzle with me.

## Translation

{% include button.html href=forms_href text="Do translation" %}

Translate the words into Chinese. Type your answers in the blanks for each question and submit. You don't need to use tone marks.

## Quizizz
