Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome back to our remote Chinese language class in the second week. In this week, students are going to practice and finish more activities about fruits.

Students need parents' help with the following contents. These activities are for several days. Students don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your kids' schedule and study on their own pace.

## Read the book

Watch the video to learn the story in Chinese about a very hungry little snake.

Student may not be able to understand every single Chinese words in the story and they're not expected to remember all of them after watching the video. Instead, students are expected to try to understand the main idea of the story and recall some words they learned in previous lessons (such as colors and fruits) that appeared in the video; at the same time, try to get familiar with the voice in Chinese.

## Memory game
