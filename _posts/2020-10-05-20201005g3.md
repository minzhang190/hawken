Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome to our remote Chinese language class. In this week, you are going to practice and finish more activities about fruits.

These activities are for two weeks. You don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your schedule and study on your own pace.

## Memory game

{% include button.html href="/app-memory-game/?data=fruits1&imagesAvailable=10&grid=4x5" text="Play game 1" %}{% include button.html href="/app-memory-game/?data=fruits2&imagesAvailable=10&grid=4x5" text="Play game 2" %}

Have fun with the game and I would be so excited to know how well they do in the game!

## Find the words

{% include button.html href="/app-wordfind/?fruits1ez/" text="Word find 1" %}{% include button.html href="/app-wordfind/?fruits2ez/" text="Word find 2" %}

See how many Chinese words you can find in the grid. In both games, words only go from left to right and from top to bottom.

You may need to review the spelling of the words before playing the game. Use the [slides][slides], also included at the top of this page, to help them to review.

In the game, to select the word found, press the mouse button or touch on the first letter of the word, move the cursor or finger through all letters in the word, and release the mouse button or finger on the last letter. Once all the words are found, the grid will turn green.

## Origami fruits set
