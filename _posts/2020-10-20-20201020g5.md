Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome to our remote Chinese language class. Starting from this week, you're going to learn the unit of classroom objects. In this week, you'll learn the first 12 words of 37 words in total.

These activities are for several days. You don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your schedule and study on your own pace.

## Make your own vocabulary list

Learn the words using materials below, and write the Chinese words with their meanings in English on your notebook. You can use the following format as an example:

| **Chinese** | **English** |
|---------|---------|
| Píngguǒ | Apple   |
| Shūbāo  | Backpack|
| Yīfu    | Clothes |
| ...     | ...     |

After finishing your vocabulary list, take a picture of it and share it with me. You can either email me or submit it on Google Classroom.

## Learn the words

Check out the slides to learn the vocabulary. In the slides, you're going to learn those 12 words in this unit.

Pay attention to the pronunciation of each word. Each word will be read twice in Chinese followed by once in English. After all the words, there will be a mini-quiz for self-check.

## Vocabulary game

You're ready to earn some points!

{% include clear.html %}

The three game modes provide different difficulty levels where the first game is the easiest and the third game is the hardest. Remember, the learning mode is always available if you need some reminder of the words.

## Try to read

You'll practice pronunciation yourself by reading the words to the computer. Your pronunciation will be recorded and sent to me automatically.

For this part, I recommend using [Google Chrome][chrome] on a computer or Android device to finish the activity. In each word card, the picture and its pinyin are given. When you click the "Go" button, the computer will read the word first, and then ask you to read it and record your pronunciation for a maximum of 10 seconds, or you can stop the recording at a earlier time manually. A playback option is also available so you can listen to your own pronounciation, and record it again if you're not satisified with your previous attempt.

## Watch the video

Refresh your memory by watching this video.

Focus on the spelling of the words to get yourself prepared for the next fun challenge.

## Find the words

{% include button.html href="/app-wordfind/?clsrmobj1/" text="Word find" %}

See how many Chinese words you can find in the grid.

{% include clear.html %}

In the first game, words only go from left to right, from top to bottom, from top-left to bottom-right, and from top-right to bottom-left. In the second one, they can be in all eight directions.

To select the word you found in the game, press the mouse button or touch on the first letter of the word, move the cursor or your finger through all letters in the word, and release the mouse button or your finger on the last letter. Once you finish all the words, the grid will turn green. You can share the finished puzzle with me.

Remember you can always click on the "Create New Game" button to receive a new challenge. Also keep in mind that the same sequence of characters (for example, "SHU") can be used multiple times for different words, if it fits both words (for example, "SHU" and "SHUBAO").
