title: 4th Grade Chinese Week 8
category: g4
---

Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome back to our remote Chinese language class in the last week. In this week, you're going to take the new practice for sentence structures using the words we learned about the weather. You should focus on the order of words in the Chinese sentences. Try to figure out the way how the concepts are expressed in Chinese yourself and summarize it.

These activities are for several days. You don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your schedule and study on your own pace.

## Check in
