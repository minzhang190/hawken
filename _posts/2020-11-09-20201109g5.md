Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome to our remote Chinese language class. Starting from this week, you're going to learn and review the unit of classroom objects. In this week, you'll learn and review the next 12 out of 37 words in total in this week.

These activities are for several days. You don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your schedule and study on your own pace.

## Make your own vocabulary list

Learn the words using materials below, and write the Chinese words with their meanings in English on your notebook. You can use the following format as an example:

| **Chinese** | **English** |
|---------|---------|
| Píngguǒ | Apple   |
| Shūbāo  | Backpack|
| Yīfu    | Clothes |
| ...     | ...     |

After finishing your vocabulary list, take a picture of it and share it with me. You can either email me or submit it on Google Classroom.

## Learn the words

{% include button.html href="/app-slides/?clsrmobj2/" text="View slides" %}

Check out the slides to learn the vocabulary. In the slides, you're going to learn those 12 words in this unit.

{% include clear.html %}

Pay attention to the pronunciation of each word. Each word will be read twice in Chinese followed by once in English. After all the words, there will be a mini-quiz for self-check.

## Whack-a-mole!

{% include button.html href="/app-whack-a-mole/?data=clsrmobj2" text="Whack-a-mole!" %}

This game will help you to review the words you just learned in the slides. 

{% include clear.html %}

There are three levels in this game. Earn enough points in the first level to advance to the next level.

## Try to read

{% include button.html href="/app-read/?clsrmobj2/#{%22service%22:%22record-firebase%22}" text="Read" %}

You'll practice pronunciation yourself by reading the words to the computer. Your pronunciation will be recorded and sent to me automatically.

{% include clear.html %}

For this part, I recommend using [Google Chrome][chrome] on a computer or Android device to finish the activity. In each word card, the picture and its pinyin are given. When you click the "Go" button, the computer will read the word first, and then ask you to read it and record your pronunciation for a maximum of 10 seconds, or you can stop the recording at a earlier time manually. A playback option is also available so you can listen to your own pronounciation, and record it again if you're not satisified with your previous attempt.

## Find the words

{% include button.html href="/app-wordfind/?clsrmobj2/" text="Word find" %}

See how many Chinese words you can find in the grid.

{% include clear.html %}

In the first game, words only go from left to right, from top to bottom, from top-left to bottom-right, and from top-right to bottom-left. In the second one, they can be in all eight directions.

In the game, to select the word you found, press the mouse button or touch on the first letter of the word, move the cursor or your finger through all letters in the word, and release the mouse button or your finger on the last letter. Once you finish all the words, the grid will turn green. You can share the finished puzzle with me.

## Translation
