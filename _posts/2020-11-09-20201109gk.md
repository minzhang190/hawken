Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome to our remote Chinese language class. Starting from this week, you are going to work on the new unit of animals. In this week, we will learn farm animals.

These activities are for two weeks. You don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your schedule and study on your own pace.

## Learn the words

Check out the slides to learn the vocabulary. In the slides, students are going to learn the words in this unit.

Pay attention to the pronunciation of each word. Each word will be read twice in Chinese followed by once in English. After all the words, there will be a mini-quiz for self-check.

## Vocabulary game

You're ready to earn some points!

The three game modes provide different difficulty levels where the first game is the easiest and the third game is the hardest. Remember, the learning mode is always available if you need some reminder of the words.

## Try to read

{% include button.html href="/app-read/?animals1/#{%22service%22:%22record-firebase%22}" text="Read 1" %}{% include button.html href="/app-read/?animals2/#{%22service%22:%22record-firebase%22}" text="Read 2" %}

You'll practice pronunciation yourself by reading the words to the computer. Your pronunciation will be recorded and sent to me automatically.

For this part, I recommend using [Google Chrome][chrome] on a computer or Android device to finish the activity. In each word card, the picture and its pinyin are given. When you click the "Go" button, the computer will read the word first, and then ask you to read it and record your pronunciation for a maximum of 10 seconds, or you can stop the recording at a earlier time manually. A playback option is also available so you can listen to your own pronounciation, and record it again if you're not satisified with your previous attempt.

## Watch the video
