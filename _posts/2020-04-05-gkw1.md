Dear kindergartners,

I hope you all doing well and welcome to the new method of learning Chinese.

For the first week we are going to review *Fruits*. You are going to use some online resources to help you with your learning.

Students may need parents' help with the following learning steps.

## Step 1

Go to [this online lesson][slides] I created for you to learn the new words and finish the small game after your learning.

## Step 2

Refresh your memory by watching [this video][video].

## Step 3

After all the hard working on the vocabulary, my dear kindergarten language learners, you're ready to take the challenge! Are you ready? [Earn some points here][vocab]. The three game modes provide different difficulty levels where the first game is the easiest and the third game is the hardest.

## Step 4

Go to [the game "Kahoot Challenge"][kahoot]. Remember to type your First Name so that I can keep track with all of you. Please type your real name, don't make up names.
