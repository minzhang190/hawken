Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome back to our remote Chinese language class in the fourth week. In this week, you're going to continue to work on the unit of classroom objects.

These activities are for several days. You don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your schedule and study on your own pace.

## Identify yourself

{% include button.html href="/app-identify/" text="Identify me" %}

Stop by this identification page and enter your name, then submit.

{% include clear.html %}

This will allow me to track your progress. It's recommended that every time you come back to these activities, check out the identification page first, and if your name is not shown there, provide it again so it can get tracked correctly.

## Kahoot

{% include button.html href="https://kahoot.it/challenge/09073899?challenge-id=9f4e2e9f-9b72-4be5-8348-38204d05d88d_1587872203817" text="Kahoot challenge" %}

Go to the game "Kahoot Challenge". Before game start type your First Name so that I can keep track with all of you. Please type your real name, don’t make up names.

## Translation

{% include button.html href=forms_href text="Do translation" %}

Translate the sentences into Chinese. Type your answers in the blanks for each question and submit. You don't need to use tone marks. You can always go back to [resources from the last week][g3w3] to review.

## Flipgrid

{% include button.html href="https://flipgrid.com/cd94986f" text="Record video" %}

On the linked Flipgrid page, you can record a video to share with me and the rest of our class. Read the descriptions and requirements for this task, then click the green plus sign and enter your name to start recording. I'll share your video with your classmates and you can come back later to see any video recorded by others. You can also let me know if you don't want your video to be shared.
