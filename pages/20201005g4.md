Nǐ hǎo nán hái nǚ hái! Welcome to our remote Chinese language class. In this week, you're going to practice and finish more activities of the unit of body parts and health.

These activities are for two weeks. You don't need to finish all of them at once or even in one day. Make a plan suitable for your schedule and study on your own pace.

## Learn the words

Check out the slides to learn the vocabulary. In the slides, you're going to learn and review those 30 words in this unit.

Pay attention to the pronunciation of each word. Each word will be read twice in Chinese followed by once in English. After all the words, there will be a mini-quiz for self-check.

## Find the words

See how many Chinese words you can find in the grid.

{% include clear.html %}

In the first game, words only go from left to right, from top to bottom, from top-left to bottom-right, and from top-right to bottom-left. In the second one, they can be in all eight directions.

In the game, to select the word you found, press the mouse button or touch on the first letter of the word, move the cursor or your finger through all letters in the word, and release the mouse button or your finger on the last letter. Once you finish all the words, the grid will turn green. You can share the finished puzzle with me.
