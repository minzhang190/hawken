## Google Analytics

I'm using various techniques to track your participation and study progress, including using tools from Google like Google Analytics, to better understand how well you do and what you need, and to gauge the contents to include in the coming weeks. The recording activity also uses the same facility to associate your recordings with your name; otherwise, they'll be saved without attribution to a particular student like you.

Unfortunately some ad blockers aggressively block these components, under the assumption that they waste network resources and invade user privacy. I recommend you to turn off your ad blockers while studying my contents to allow your study activities to be shared with me. All the contents will still work in your current environment if you don't do anything, but I won't see your progress from my student reports, unless you actively tell me about it by writing to me.
